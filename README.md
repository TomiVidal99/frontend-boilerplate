# Front End Boilerplate

_This boilerplate it's your base for your front end projects. The intention it's for it to be a simple, highly readable and modifiable as a strong intial ground for you to start building web applications._

## File Structure

![Project File Structure](./src/assets/frontend-boilerplate-file-structure.png)

## Features

- React.
- SASS.
- Webpack.
- live loader.

## Usage

### Development

You just need to run `yarn start` to start the development server (by default will use the port 3000 and host it on the local network, you can change that in the webpack.config.js).

### Production

Run the command `yarn build:linux` if you're in linux or mac. If you're on windows use `yarn build:windows`. The output of these commands will be located at the /dist folder.

## Why Another Boilerplate

_Basically i was looking for a simple boilerplate to get me started on my projects and even though i was able to find many the complexity of them made it so hard get setup (controversial right?). And even after setting everything up and ended coding i was about to deploy when the code wouldn't build for production, and after (many) hours of debugging some others people code i was not able to get it to work, and so i decided to make this boilerplate._

## TODO

- [ ] Improve the File Structure display.
- [ ] Clean the log on server update.
- [x] Add images to this readme.
- [x] Optimize production.
- [x] Add a map of the file structure. Maybe adapt it for Redux?
